Plan 9 Community Code of Conduct
================================

The Plan 9community has always worked to be welcoming and respectful, and we want to ensure that doesn't change as we grow and evolve.

All contributors do it in their spare time as a hobby. Other people will use your contribution, and you, in turn, will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect other users. You should take those consequences into account.

All community members come from around the world, from different countries, with different religious faith, political views, people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion or lack thereof, and mental and physical ability.

Please choose your words carefully and be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Violent threats or language directed against another person;
* Discriminatory jokes and language;
* Posting sexually explicit or violent material;
* Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
* Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

So we have a few rules that we ask people to follow:

* Be friendly and patient;
* Be welcoming;
* Be considerate;
* Be respectful;
* Be collaborative;
* Be careful in the words you choose and be kind to others. When we disagree, try to understand why.

These rules should be considered in all areas and canals of this project, such as our  mailing list, wiki, IRC, etc.
